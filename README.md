### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm SamyLyy, a student from Germany who wants to become a Software engineer.

My dream is to once have a software-development start-up.

When I'm not coding, I'm playing Handball, practising Piano, watching Anime or playing games. I also really enjoy writing novels.

#### Facts about me:
-My favourite Animes are Lycoris Recoil, Oshi no Ko and Bunny Girl Senpai

-My favourite games are Hollow Knight and Zelda BOTW
